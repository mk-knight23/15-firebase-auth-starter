# Design System: 15-firebase-auth-starter

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Secure OS / Cyber-Protocol** aesthetic. It uses a deep night void (#020617) as the canvas, accented by "Secure Blue" (Blue-600) and high-fidelity glassmorphism to create a sense of enterprise-grade reliability.

## Design Patterns
-   **Technical Glassmorphism**: High-blur backdrops with subtle 1px borders to define secure boundaries.
-   **Biometric Visuals**: Use of fingerprint and lock icons as primary design anchors.
-   **Depth Blobs**: Layered radial gradients in the background to provide spatial awareness without distracting from the UI.
-   **Modular Sidebar**: Technical vertical navigation with indicator pulses for active states.

## Color Palette
-   **OS Void**: Midnight Slate (#020617)
-   **Technical Primary**: Blue-600 (#2563eb)
-   **Security Text**: Slate-100 (#f1f5f9)
-   **Muted Metadata**: Slate-500/600 (#64748b)

## Interaction Design
-   **Protocol Switching**: Smooth "wait" mode transitions in AnimatePresence for auth view changes.
-   **Input Feedback**: High-contrast focus states for email/password fields with consistent tech-themed icons.
-   **Tactile Actions**: Active scaling (95%) on authentication triggers to provide immediate session initialization feedback.
